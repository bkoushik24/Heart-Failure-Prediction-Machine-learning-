# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Machine-learning-
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients using clinical data. The app was built using Python, trained using the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset, and deployed as a Flask web application with a user-friendly HTML interface styled with custom CSS.
#  Heart Failure Prediction Web App

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on clinical data. The model is trained using a heart failure dataset and deployed using a Flask backend with a simple HTML/CSS frontend.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains 13 clinical features from 299 patients. The target column `DEATH_EVENT` indicates whether the patient died during the follow-up period.

ðŸ”‘ Features Used:
- Age
- Anaemia
- Creatinine Phosphokinase
- Diabetes
- Ejection Fraction
- High Blood Pressure
- Platelets
- Serum Creatinine
- Serum Sodium
- Sex
- Smoking
- Time
- DEATH_EVENT (Target variable)

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Train a classification model to predict heart failure with >80% accuracy.
- Build a web app using Flask that allows user input and shows prediction results.
- Style the interface using custom CSS.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python,Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn
- Flask(Backend Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS(Frontend)
